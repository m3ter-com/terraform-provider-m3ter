* FALSE - the entity is not in the archived state.
- `code` (String) The short code for the entity.
- `org_id` (String, Deprecated)
- `version` (Number) The version number of the entity:
- **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - *do not use for Create*. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the response.
