# m3ter_meter (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "m3ter_meter" "example_meter" {
  org_id = "orgId"
  code = "S?oC\"$]C] ]]]]]5]"
  data_fields = [{
    category = "WHO"
    code = "{1{}}_"
    name = "x"
    unit = "x"
  }]
  derived_fields = [{
    category = "WHO"
    code = "{1{}}_"
    name = "x"
    unit = "x"
    calculation = "x"
  }]
  name = "x"
  custom_fields = {
    foo = "string"
  }
  group_id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  product_id = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

## Schema

### Required

- `code` (String) Code of the Meter - unique short code used to identify the Meter.

**NOTE:** Code has a maximum length of 80 characters and must not contain non-printable or whitespace characters (except space), and cannot start/end with whitespace.
- `data_fields` (Attributes List) Used to submit categorized raw usage data values for ingest into the platform - either numeric quantitative values or non-numeric data values. At least one required per Meter; maximum 15 per Meter. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data_fields))
- `derived_fields` (Attributes List) Used to submit usage data values for ingest into the platform that are the result of a calculation performed on `dataFields`, `customFields`, or system `Timestamp` fields. Raw usage data is not submitted using `derivedFields`. Maximum 15 per Meter. *(Optional)*.

**Note:** Required parameter. If you want to create a Meter without Derived Fields, use an empty array `[]`. If you use a `null`, you'll receive an error. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--derived_fields))
- `name` (String) Descriptive name for the Meter.

### Optional

- `custom_fields` (Dynamic) User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom field can be either a string or a number.

If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

See [Working with Custom Fields](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/creating-and-managing-products/working-with-custom-fields) in the m3ter documentation for more information.
- `group_id` (String) UUID of the group the Meter belongs to. *(Optional)*.
- `org_id` (String, Deprecated)
- `product_id` (String) UUID of the product the Meter belongs to. *(Optional)* - if left blank, the Meter is global.

### Read-Only

- `created_by` (String) The id of the user who created this meter.
- `dt_created` (String) The DateTime when the meter was created *(in ISO-8601 format)*.
- `dt_last_modified` (String) The DateTime when the meter was last modified *(in ISO-8601 format)*.
- `id` (String) The UUID of the entity.
- `last_modified_by` (String) The id of the user who last modified this meter.
- `version` (Number) The version number:
- **Create:** On initial Create to insert a new entity, the version is set at 1 in the response.
- **Update:** On successful Update, the version is incremented by 1 in the response.

### Nested Schema for `data_fields`

Required:

- `category` (String) The type of field (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, MEASURE, METADATA, INCOME, COST, OTHER).
Available values: "WHO", "WHERE", "WHAT", "OTHER", "METADATA", "MEASURE", "INCOME", "COST".
- `code` (String) Short code to identify the field

**NOTE:** Code has a maximum length of 80 characters and can only contain letters, numbers, underscore, and the dollar character, and must not start with a number.
- `name` (String) Descriptive name of the field.

Optional:

- `unit` (String) The units to measure the data with. Should conform to *Unified Code for Units of Measure* (UCUM). Required only for numeric field categories.


<a id="nestedatt--derived_fields"></a>
### Nested Schema for `derived_fields`

Required:

- `calculation` (String) The calculation used to transform the value of submitted `dataFields` in usage data. Calculation can reference `dataFields`, `customFields`, or system `Timestamp` fields. 
*(Example: datafieldms  datafieldgb)*
- `category` (String) The type of field (WHO, WHAT, WHERE, MEASURE, METADATA, INCOME, COST, OTHER).
Available values: "WHO", "WHERE", "WHAT", "OTHER", "METADATA", "MEASURE", "INCOME", "COST".
- `code` (String) Short code to identify the field

**NOTE:** Code has a maximum length of 80 characters and can only contain letters, numbers, underscore, and the dollar character, and must not start with a number.
- `name` (String) Descriptive name of the field.

Optional:

- `unit` (String) The units to measure the data with. Should conform to *Unified Code for Units of Measure* (UCUM). Required only for numeric field categories.
