## Schema

### Required

- `bill_frequency` (String) Determines the frequency at which bills are generated.

* **Daily**. Starting at midnight each day, covering the twenty-four hour period following.

* **Weekly**. Starting at midnight on a Monday, covering the seven-day period following.

* **Monthly**. Starting at midnight on the first day of each month, covering the entire calendar month following.

* **Annually**. Starting at midnight on first day of each year covering the entire calendar year following.
Available values: "DAILY", "WEEKLY", "MONTHLY", "ANNUALLY", "AD_HOC", "MIXED".
- `currency` (String) The ISO currency code for the currency used to charge end users - for example USD, GBP, EUR. This defines the *pricing currency* and is inherited by any Plans based on the Plan Template.

**Notes:**
* You can define a currency at Organization-level or Account-level to be used as the *billing currency*. This can be a different currency to that used for the Plan as the *pricing currency*.
* If the billing currency for an Account is different to the pricing currency used by a Plan attached to the Account, you must ensure a *currency conversion rate* is defined for your Organization to convert the pricing currency into the billing currency at billing, otherwise Bills will fail for the Account.
* To define any required currency conversion rates, use the `currencyConversions` request body parameter for the [Update OrganizationConfig](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/api#tag/OrganizationConfig/operation/UpdateOrganizationConfig) call.
- `name` (String) Descriptive name for the PlanTemplate.
- `product_id` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) of the Product associated with this PlanTemplate.
- `standing_charge` (Number) The fixed charge *(standing charge)* applied to customer bills. This charge is prorated and must be a non-negative number.

### Optional

- `bill_frequency_interval` (Number) How often bills are issued. 
For example, if `billFrequency` is Monthly and `billFrequencyInterval` is 3, bills are issued every three months.
- `code` (String) A unique, short code reference for the PlanTemplate. This code should not contain control characters or spaces.
- `custom_fields` (Dynamic) User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom field can be either a string or a number.

If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

See [Working with Custom Fields](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/creating-and-managing-products/working-with-custom-fields) in the m3ter documentation for more information.
- `minimum_spend` (Number) The Product minimum spend amount per billing cycle for end customer Accounts on a pricing Plan based on the PlanTemplate. This must be a non-negative number.
- `minimum_spend_bill_in_advance` (Boolean) A boolean that determines when the minimum spend is billed.

* TRUE - minimum spend is billed at the start of each billing period.
* FALSE - minimum spend is billed at the end of each billing period.

Overrides the setting at Organizational level for minimum spend billing in arrears/in advance.
- `minimum_spend_description` (String) Minimum spend description *(displayed on the bill line item)*.
- `ordinal` (Number) The ranking of the PlanTemplate among your pricing plans. Lower numbers represent more basic plans, while higher numbers represent premium plans. This must be a non-negative integer.

**NOTE: DEPRECATED** - do not use.
- `org_id` (String, Deprecated)
- `standing_charge_bill_in_advance` (Boolean) A boolean that determines when the standing charge is billed.

* TRUE - standing charge is billed at the start of each billing period.
* FALSE - standing charge is billed at the end of each billing period.

Overrides the setting at Organizational level for standing charge billing in arrears/in advance.
- `standing_charge_description` (String) Standing charge description *(displayed on the bill line item)*.
- `standing_charge_interval` (Number) How often the standing charge is applied. 
For example, if the bill is issued every three months and `standingChargeInterval` is 2, then the standing charge is applied every six months.
- `standing_charge_offset` (Number) Defines an offset for when the standing charge is first applied. 
For example, if the bill is issued every three months and the `standingChargeOfset` is 0, then the charge is applied to the first bill *(at three months)*; if 1, it would be applied to the second bill *(at six months)*, and so on.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The UUID of the entity.
- `version` (Number) The version number:
- **Create:** On initial Create to insert a new entity, the version is set at 1 in the response.
- **Update:** On successful Update, the version is incremented by 1 in the response.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import m3ter_plan_template.example '<org_id>/<id>'
