## Schema

If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

- `minimum_spend_accounting_product_id` (String) Optional. Product ID to attribute the PlanGroup's minimum spend for accounting purposes.
- `minimum_spend_bill_in_advance` (Boolean) A boolean flag that determines when the minimum spend is billed. This flag overrides the setting at Organizational level for minimum spend billing in arrears/in advance.

* **TRUE** - minimum spend is billed at the start of each billing period.
