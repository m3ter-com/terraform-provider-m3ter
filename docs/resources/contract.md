## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) of the Account associated with this Contract.
- `end_date` (String) The exclusive end date of the Contract *(in ISO-8601 format)*. This means the Contract is active until midnight on the day ***before*** this date.
- `name` (String) The name of the Contract.
- `start_date` (String) The start date for the Contract *(in ISO-8601 format)*. This date is inclusive, meaning the Contract is active from this date onward.

### Optional

- `code` (String) The short code of the Contract.
- `custom_fields` (Dynamic) User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom field can be either a string or a number.

If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

See [Working with Custom Fields](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/creating-and-managing-products/working-with-custom-fields) in the m3ter documentation for more information.
- `description` (String) The description of the Contract, which provides context and information.
- `org_id` (String, Deprecated)
- `purchase_order_number` (String) The Purchase Order Number associated with the Contract.
- `version` (Number) The version number of the entity:
- **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - *do not use for Create*. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the response.
- **Update Entity:**  On Update, version is required and must match the existing version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

### Read-Only

- `created_by` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) of the user who created this Contract.
- `dt_created` (String) The date and time *(in ISO-8601 format)* when the Contract was created.
- `dt_last_modified` (String) The date and time *(in ISO-8601 format)* when the Contract was last modified.
- `id` (String) The UUID of the entity.
- `last_modified_by` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) of the user who last modified this Contract.
