### Nested Schema for `credentials`

Required:

- `api_key` (String) The API key provided by m3ter. This key is part of the credential set required for signing requests and authenticating with m3ter services.
- `secret` (String) The secret associated with the API key. This secret is used in conjunction with the API key to generate a signature for secure authentication.
- `type` (String) Specifies the authorization type. For this schema, it is exclusively set to M3TER_SIGNED_REQUEST.
Available values: "M3TER_SIGNED_REQUEST".

Optional:

- `empty` (Boolean) A flag to indicate whether the credentials are empty. 

* TRUE - empty credentials.
* FALSE - credential details required.

Read-Only:

- `version` (Number) The version number of the entity:
- **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - *do not use for Create*. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the response.
- **Update Entity:**  On Update, version is required and must match the existing version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.
