### Nested Schema for `permission_policy`

Required:

- `action` (List of String) The actions available to users who are assigned the Permission Policy - what they can do or cannot do with respect to the specified resource.

**NOTE:** Use lower case and a colon-separated format, for example, if you want to confer full CRUD, use:
```
"config:create",
"config:delete",
"config:retrieve",
"config:update"
```
- `effect` (String) Specifies whether or not the user is allowed to perform the action on the resource.

**NOTE:** Use lower case, for example: `"allow"`. If you use upper case, you'll receive an error.
Available values: "ALLOW", "DENY".
- `resource` (List of String) See [Statements - Available Resources](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/managing-organization-and-users/creating-and-managing-permissions#statements---available-resources) for a listing of available resources for Permission Policy statements.
