## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) for the end customer Account.
- `currency` (String) The currency code used for the Balance amount. For example: USD, GBP or EUR.
- `end_date` (String) The date *(in ISO 8601 format)* after which the Balance will no longer be active for the Account.

**Note:** You can use the `rolloverEndDate` request parameter to define an extended grace period for continued draw-down against the Balance if any amount remains when the specified `endDate` is reached.
- `start_date` (String) The date *(in ISO 8601 format)* when the Balance becomes active.

### Optional

- `balance_draw_down_description` (String) A description for the bill line items for draw-down charges against the Balance. *(Optional).*
- `code` (String) Unique short code for the Balance.
- `consumptions_accounting_product_id` (String) Optional Product ID this Balance Consumptions should be attributed to for accounting purposes
- `contract_id` (String)
- `custom_fields` (Dynamic) User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom field can be either a string or a number.

If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

See [Working with Custom Fields](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/creating-and-managing-products/working-with-custom-fields) in the m3ter documentation for more information.
- `description` (String) A description of the Balance.
- `fees_accounting_product_id` (String) Optional Product ID this Balance Fees should be attributed to for accounting purposes
- `line_item_types` (List of String) Specify the line item charge types that can draw-down at billing against the  Balance amount. Options are:
- `"MINIMUM_SPEND"`
- `"STANDING_CHARGE"`
- `"USAGE"`
- `"COUNTER_RUNNING_TOTAL_CHARGE"`
- `"COUNTER_ADJUSTMENT_DEBIT"`

**NOTE:** If no charge types are specified, by default *all types* can draw-down against the Balance amount at billing.
- `name` (String) The official name for the Balance.
- `org_id` (String, Deprecated)
- `overage_description` (String) A description for Bill line items overage charges.
- `overage_surcharge_percent` (Number) Define a surcharge level, as a percentage of regular usage rating, applied to overages *(usage charges that exceed the Balance amount)*. For example, if the regular usage rate is $10 per unit of usage consumed and `overageSurchargePercent` is set at 10%, then any usage charged above the original Balance amount is charged at $11 per unit of usage.
- `product_ids` (List of String) Specify the Products whose consumption charges due at billing can be drawn-down against the Balance amount.

**Note:** If you don't specify any Products for Balance draw-down, by default the consumption charges for any Product the Account consumes will be drawn-down against the Balance amount.
- `rollover_amount` (Number) The maximum amount that can be carried over past the Balance end date for draw-down at billing if there is any unused Balance amount when the end date is reached. Works with `rolloverEndDate` to define the amount and duration of a Balance "grace period". *(Optional)*

**Notes:**
- If you leave `rolloverAmount` empty and only enter a `rolloverEndDate`, any amount left over after the Balance end date is reached will be drawn-down against up to the specified `rolloverEndDate`.
- You must enter a `rolloverEndDate`. If you only enter a `rolloverAmount` without entering a `rolloverEndDate`, you'll receive an error when trying to create or update the Balance.
- If you don't want to grant any grace period for outstanding Balance amounts, then do not use `rolloverAmount` and `rolloverEndDate`.
- `rollover_end_date` (String) The end date *(in ISO 8601 format)* for the grace period during which unused Balance amounts can be carried over and drawn-down against at billing.

**Note:** Use `rolloverAmount` if you want to specify a maximum amount that can be carried over and made available for draw-down.

### Read-Only

- `amount` (Number) The financial value that the Balance holds.
- `id` (String) The UUID of the entity.
- `version` (Number) The version number:
- **Create:** On initial Create to insert a new entity, the version is set at 1 in the response.
- **Update:** On successful Update, the version is incremented by 1 in the response.
