## Schema

### Optional

- `find_one_by` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--find_one_by))
- `org_id` (String, Deprecated)

### Read-Only

- `code` (String) Code of the Meter - unique short code used to identify the Meter.
- `custom_fields` (Dynamic) User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom field can be either a string or a number.

If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational level,`customField` values defined at individual level override values of `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

See [Working with Custom Fields](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/creating-and-managing-products/working-with-custom-fields) in the m3ter documentation for more information.
- `data_fields` (Attributes List) Used to submit categorized raw usage data values for ingest into the platform - either numeric quantitative values or non-numeric data values. At least one required per Meter; maximum 15 per Meter. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--data_fields))
- `derived_fields` (Attributes List) Used to submit usage data values for ingest into the platform that are the result of a calculation performed on `dataFields`, `customFields`, or system `Timestamp` fields. Raw usage data is not submitted using `derivedFields`. Maximum 15 per Meter. *(Optional)*. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--derived_fields))
- `group_id` (String) UUID of the MeterGroup the Meter belongs to. *(Optional)*.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `name` (String) Descriptive name for the Meter.
- `product_id` (String) UUID of the Product the Meter belongs to. *(Optional)* - if blank, the Meter is global.
- `version` (Number) The version number:
- **Create:** On initial Create to insert a new entity, the version is set at 1 in the response.
- **Update:** On successful Update, the version is incremented by 1 in the response.
