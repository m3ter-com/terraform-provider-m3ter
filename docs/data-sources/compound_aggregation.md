# m3ter_compound_aggregation (Data Source)



## Example Usage

```terraform
data "m3ter_compound_aggregation" "example_compound_aggregation" {
  org_id = "orgId"
  id = "id"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `org_id` (String, Deprecated)

### Optional

- `find_one_by` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--find_one_by))

### Read-Only

- `accounting_product_id` (String)
- `calculation` (String) This field is a string that represents the formula for the calculation. This formula determines how the CompoundAggregation is calculated from the underlying usage data.
- `code` (String) Code of the Aggregation. A unique short code to identify the Aggregation.
- `custom_fields` (Dynamic)
- `evaluate_null_aggregations` (Boolean) This is a boolean True / False flag. 

If set to TRUE, the calculation will be evaluated even if the referenced aggregation has no usage data.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `name` (String) Descriptive name for the Aggregation.
- `product_id` (String) This field represents the unique identifier (UUID) of the Product that is associated with the CompoundAggregation.
- `quantity_per_unit` (Number) Defines how much of a quantity equates to 1 unit. Used when setting the price per unit for billing purposes - if charging for kilobytes per second (KiBy/s) at rate of $0.25 per 500 KiBy/s, then set quantityPerUnit to 500 and price Plan at $0.25 per unit.

If `quantityPerUnit` is set to a value other than one, rounding is typically set to UP.
- `rounding` (String) Specifies how you want to deal with non-integer, fractional number Aggregation values.

**NOTES:**
* **NEAREST** rounds to the nearest half: 5.1 is rounded to 5, and 3.5 is rounded to 4.
* Also used in combination with `quantityPerUnit`. Rounds the number of units after `quantityPerUnit` is applied. If you set `quantityPerUnit` to a value other than one, you would typically set Rounding to **UP**. For example, suppose you charge by kilobytes per second (KiBy/s), set `quantityPerUnit` = 500, and set charge rate at $0.25 per unit used. If your customer used 48,900 KiBy/s in a billing period, the charge would be 48,900 / 500 = 97.8 rounded up to 98 * 0.25 = $2.45.

Enum: ???UP??? ???DOWN??? ???NEAREST??? ???NONE???
Available values: "UP", "DOWN", "NEAREST", "NONE".
- `segments` (List of Map of String) *(Optional)*. Used when creating a segmented Aggregation, which segments the usage data collected by a single Meter. Works together with `segmentedFields`.

Contains the values that are to be used as the segments, read from the fields in the meter pointed at by `segmentedFields`.
- `unit` (String) User defined or following the *Unified Code for Units of Measure* (UCUM). 

Used as the label for billing, indicating to your customers what they are being charged for.
- `version` (Number) The version number:
- **Create:** On initial Create to insert a new entity, the version is set at 1 in the response.
- **Update:** On successful Update, the version is incremented by 1 in the response.

### Nested Schema for `find_one_by`

Optional:

- `codes` (List of String) An optional parameter to retrieve specific CompoundAggregations based on their short codes.
- `ids` (List of String) An optional parameter to retrieve specific CompoundAggregations based on their unique identifiers (UUIDs).
- `product_id` (List of String) An optional parameter to filter the CompoundAggregations based on specific Product unique identifiers (UUIDs).
