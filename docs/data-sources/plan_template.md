If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational level,`customField` values defined at individual level override values of `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

For example, if the bill is issued every three months and `standingChargeInterval` is 2, then the standing charge is applied every six months.
- `standing_charge_offset` (Number) Defines an offset for when the standing charge is first applied. 
For example, if the bill is issued every three months and the `standingChargeOfset` is 0, then the charge is applied to the first bill *(at three months)*; if 1, it would be applied to the second bill *(at six months)*, and so on.
